Dearest friends and family,

<p>Welcome to our site. We are in the process of organising our wedding at the <a href="http://www.aberdeenmarinaclub.com/">Aberdeen Marina Club, Hong Kong</a> on the 10th of January, 2014. </p>

<iframe width="680" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://maps.google.com.au/maps?q=8+Shum+Wan+Road,Aberdeen,+Hong+Kong&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=8+Shum+Wan+Rd,+Hong+Kong&amp;t=m&amp;ll=22.244377,114.164858&amp;spn=0.047666,0.058365&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A&amp;output=embed"></iframe>

<p>Public transport is readily available from Admiralty MTR station (Bus route 75) and Causeway Bay MTR station (Bus route 72A), and there will be busses chartered after the night is over. </p>

<p>We would be very grateful if you would consider joining us for this event! It is a very big ask on our behalf, as there is such a long distance to travel for many of you. Please feel free to explore the rest of the site and consider filling out the RSVP form (information will be kept confidential)</p>

<p>Schedule of events: Ceremony (5pm, The Marina Suite), Reception (6pm, Grand Ballroom)</p>

<p>More information will gradually be added to this site.</p>

Thank you all for being a part of our lives. <br>Angela and Thomas
